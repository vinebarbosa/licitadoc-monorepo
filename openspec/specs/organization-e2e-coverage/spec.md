# organization-e2e-coverage Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-organization-management-e2e-tests. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Organization-management E2E coverage MUST verify organization onboarding and scoped reads over real HTTP
The system MUST include API end-to-end tests that call the real `/api/organizations/*` routes with authenticated sessions and verify onboarding, list, and detail behavior across administrative scopes.

#### Scenario: Organization owner without an organization completes onboarding
- **WHEN** an E2E test authenticates as an `organization_owner` who is not linked to any organization and sends a valid `POST /api/organizations/` request
- **THEN** the API returns the created organization payload
- **AND** the stored organization record is created and linked to the actor

#### Scenario: Admin and organization owner read organizations within their allowed scope
- **WHEN** an E2E test authenticates as an `admin` and requests organization list or detail routes
- **THEN** the API returns stored organizations across administrative scope
- **AND** when an E2E test authenticates as an `organization_owner`, the list includes only the owned organization and reading another organization's detail is rejected

### Requirement: Organization-management E2E coverage MUST verify persisted updates and role-based field restrictions over real HTTP
The system MUST include API end-to-end tests that update organizations through the real management routes while asserting the resulting stored organization state and owner-specific field restrictions.

#### Scenario: Admin updates organization data and status
- **WHEN** an E2E test authenticates as an `admin` and sends a valid `PATCH /api/organizations/:organizationId` request including allowed administrative fields
- **THEN** the API returns the updated organization payload
- **AND** the stored organization record reflects the requested changes, including administrative status fields such as `isActive`

#### Scenario: Organization owner updates the owned profile but cannot change admin-only fields
- **WHEN** an E2E test authenticates as an `organization_owner` and updates the owned organization with allowed profile fields
- **THEN** the API persists the allowed changes
- **AND** a request from that same actor to change an admin-only field such as `isActive` is rejected without changing the stored status

### Requirement: Organization-management E2E coverage MUST verify auth-dependent rejection paths
The system MUST include API end-to-end tests for failures that depend on authentication, actor role, onboarding eligibility, or organization scope.

#### Scenario: Disallowed or already-linked actors cannot create organizations through onboarding
- **WHEN** an E2E test calls `POST /api/organizations/` as an `admin`, a `member`, or an `organization_owner` who already belongs to an organization
- **THEN** the API rejects the request
- **AND** no additional organization is created for the actor

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated or out-of-scope actors cannot read or update organizations
- **WHEN** an E2E test calls organization list, detail, or update routes without an authorized session or with an actor outside the allowed organization scope
- **THEN** the API rejects the request
- **AND** the target organization's stored data remains unchanged

### Requirement: Organization-management E2E coverage MUST run in an isolated and repeatable environment
The system MUST provide deterministic setup and cleanup for organization-management E2E scenarios so repeated local and CI runs do not depend on pre-existing auth, user, or organization state.

#### Scenario: Organization-management E2E scenarios start from clean fixture state
- **WHEN** the organization-management E2E suite starts a scenario
- **THEN** it prepares or cleans the auth, user, and organization records needed for the actors and stored organizations it exercises
